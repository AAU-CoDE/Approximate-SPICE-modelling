# Approximate-SPICE-modelling
Documentation on approximate SiC MOSFET model implementation using NGSpice DLL.

Roadmap:
- Upload the libraries
- Clean up the C code and upload it here
- Add a description about how the approximate modeling works in the README
- Automate the approximate model derivation and runs in Python, link to PyLTS interface
